## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 **Automated Heuristic Evaluation**

*   **Visibility of System Status:** Detects low contrast text and missing titles.
*   **Consistency and Standards:** Finds broken links and empty anchors.
*   **Error Prevention:** Identifies inputs missing labels or ARIA tags.
*   **Recognition rather than Recall:** Checks for missing Alt text on images.
*   **Flexibility and Efficiency:** Flags touch targets smaller than 44px.
*   And more...

### 🧭 **Interactive On-Page Navigator**
*   **Floating Widget:** A draggable, resizable dashboard injected directly into the page to navigate issues one by one.
*   **Spotlight Focus Mode:** Dims the background and highlights specific failing elements to remove visual distractions.
*   **Deep Inspection:** One-click to log the element to the Console or copy its CSS selector for quick fixing.
